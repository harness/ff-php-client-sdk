## Intro

Harness Feature Flags (FF) is a feature management solution that enables users to change the software’s functionality, without deploying new code. FF uses feature flags to hide code or behaviours without having to ship new versions of the software. A feature flag is like a powerful if statement.

## Requirements
To use this SDK, make sure you’ve:
- Installed [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 7.4 or a newer version
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency Manager for PHP
### Optional Dependencies
- [Relay Proxy](https://github.com/harness/ff-proxy)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
## Quickstart
The Feature Flag SDK provides a client that connects to the feature flag service, and fetches the value
of feature flags. The following section provides an example of how to install the SDK and initialize it from an application.

This quickstart assumes you have followed the instructions to [setup a Feature Flag project and have created a flag called `harnessappdemodarkmode` and created a server API Key](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/1j7pdkqh7j-create-a-feature-flag#step_1_create_a_project).

### Install the SDK Dependency

The first step is to install the SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager.

```
composer require harness/ff-server-sdk
```
### A Simple Example

After installing the SDK, enter the SDK keys that you created for your environment. The SDK keys authorize your application to connect to the FF client. 

```php
<?php

require_once realpath("vendor/autoload.php");

use Harness\CFClient;
use OpenAPI\Client\Model\Target;

$FLAG_KEY = "harnessappdemodarkmode";
$SDK_KEY = getenv("SDK_KEY") ?: "";  // you can put your key in env variable or you can provide in the code

$client = new CFClient($SDK_KEY, new Target(["name" => "Harness", "identifier" => "harness"]), [
	"base_url": "http://proxy-url",
	"events_url": "http://proxy-url",
]);

echo "Evaluation value for flag $FLAG_KEY with target 'harness': " . $client->evaluate($FLAG_KEY, false);
```

## Running the example

To run the example, open the browser and type:
